## Investigate a Dataset - The Movie Database (TMDb)

### Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

### Introduction
I will conduct my own data analysis and create a file to share that documents my findings. I start by taking a look at my dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I have used pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. I will not be required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but I should make it clear in my communications that my findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.
